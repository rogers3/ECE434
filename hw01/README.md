This is an etch and sketch program. The user can specify the width and height
if the picture they desire. The picture will then be created. A '.' represents
an empty space on the picture. A '#' represents where the users cursor currently
is. A 'X' represents where the cursor has previousy been (drawing). Next the
user enters one of the following instructions (not case sensitive):
    1. Right/R- this moves the cursor to the right. If the cursor is at the
        right most position it will do nothing.
    2. Left/L- this moves the cursor to the left. If the cursor is at the
        left most position it will do nothing.
    3. Up/U- this moves the cursor up. If the cursor is at the highest position
        it will do nothing.
    4. Down/D- this moves the cursor dpwn. If the cursor is at the lowest
        position it will do nothing.
    5. Clear/C- this will clear the grid (all '.' other then cursor) but NOT 
        reset the cursor
    6. Exit/E- this exits the program
